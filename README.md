## Container Usage

This action can be executed independently from workflows within a container. To do so, use the following command:

```
podman run --rm -it ghcr.io/cbrgm/bluesky-github-action:v1 --help
```

## Workflow Usage

First, ensure you have your Bluesky handle, and password. Set the following repository secrets:

* `BLUESKY_HANDLE` - Your Bluesky handle. (Example: `username.bsky.social`)
* `BLUESKY_PASSWORD` - Your password for authentication with Bluesky.

You can create a new App Password at [https://bsky.app/settings/app-passwords](https://bsky.app/settings/app-passwords).

Optional:

* `BLUESKY_PDS_URL` - Your Bluesky PDS (Personal Data Server) URL, e.g., `https://pds.blueskyweb.xyz` (Defaults to `https://blsky.social`)

Use the following step in your GitHub Actions Workflow:

```yaml
- name: Send post to Bluesky
  id: bluesky_post
  uses: cbrgm/bluesky-github-action@v1
  with:
    handle: ${{ secrets.BLUESKY_HANDLE }} # Your handle (example: username.bsky.social)
    password: ${{ secrets.BLUESKY_PASSWORD }} # Your password
    text: "Hello from GitHub Actions!" # The content of the post
```

Multiline post:

```yaml
- name: Send multiline post to Bluesky
  id: bluesky_post_multiline
  uses: cbrgm/bluesky-github-action@v1
  with:
    handle: ${{ secrets.BLUESKY_HANDLE }} # Your handle (example: username.bsky.social)
    password: ${{ secrets.BLUESKY_PASSWORD }} # Your password
    text: |
      This is a multiline post sent from GitHub Actions.
      This example demonstrates how to include multiple lines in the `text` input.
```

Post with rich links:

```yaml
- name: Send post with rich link card to Bluesky
  id: bluesky_post_link
  uses: cbrgm/bluesky-github-action@v1
  with:
    handle: ${{ secrets.BLUESKY_HANDLE }} # Your handle (example: username.bsky.social)
    password: ${{ secrets.BLUESKY_PASSWORD }} # Your password
    text: "Check out this awesome GitHub repository: https://github.com/cbrgm/bluesky-github-action"
    enable-embeds: true # Enable rich link cards (default: true)
```

Disable rich embeds (text-only URLs):

```yaml
- name: Send post without link cards to Bluesky
  id: bluesky_post_plain
  uses: cbrgm/bluesky-github-action@v1
  with:
    handle: ${{ secrets.BLUESKY_HANDLE }}
    password: ${{ secrets.BLUESKY_PASSWORD }}
    text: "Plain URL: https://github.com/cbrgm/bluesky-github-action"
    enable-embeds: false # Disable link cards, URLs will still be clickable
```
